[00:56:15.939] (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
[00:56:15.939] - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
[00:56:15.939] - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
